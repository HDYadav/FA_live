                            <p>The insurance policy compensates the insured in case of accidental death, loss of limbs and eyes, permanent total disablement and permanent partial disablement. Nowadays accidents are a matter of common occurrence and can cause Death or Disablement. An Insurance coverage would be essentially required to provide protection to the members of an organization.

                            <p>Group Insurance is simply an insurance package an organisation buys for the benefit of its employees. The organisation may design a self-insured plan itself or select a pre-planned insurance policy from an insurance company. The cost of premiums, in case of group health insurance, will vary from one insurance policy to the other. Similarly, insurance coverage, payment and premiums will also be different for each individual. You can compare group health insurance quotes of different service provider & opt for the best fit option.</p>
                            <li>GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDES SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER BENEFITS THAN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, EMPLOYEES OR GROUP MEMBERS DO NOT REQUIRE A MEDICAL CHECKUP, WAITING PERIODS FOR EXISTING DISEASES CAN BE WAIVED OFF, PREMIUMS ARE LOWER, MATERNITY EXPENSES OR CORPORATE FLOATERS CAN BE ADDED TO THE COVER. GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE IS AN EXCELLENT TOOL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENT FOR ORGANISATIONS.</li>
                            <li>IN GROUP INSURANCE POLICIES, THE RISK IS SPREAD OVER A LARGE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND THAT HELPS REDUCE THE PREMIUM COST DUE TO THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE. HOWEVER, THE PREMIUM CAN BE HIGHLY VARIABLE FOR GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE DUE TO CLAIM RATIO AND NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES/MEMBERS ADDED TO OR REMOVED FROM THE COVER.</li>
                            <li>YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THE POLICY ACCORDING TO YOUR NEEDS. YOU CAN ADD MORE BENEFITS APART FROM THE BASIC POLICY PROVISIONS ALREADY AVAILABLE IN ANY HEALTH POLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, PARENTS CAN BE COVERED, DAY CARE TREATMENTS CAN BE INCREASED, ACCIDENTAL COVER RIDER AND MATERNITY BENEFITS CAN BE INCREASED. THIS FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS THE GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUDGET WITH YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.</li>
                            <li>GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE IS ADMINISTRATIVELY MUCH EASIER TO PLACE AND YOU NEED NOT SPEND TIME IN MEDICAL CHECKS OR IN DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF INSURANCE GETTING REJECTED.</li>
