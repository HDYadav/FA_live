          <h4>Why use an Insurance Broker?</h4>
           <p>An insurance broker acts as your representative not that of the insurance company. Brokerâ€™s job is to look after your interests and find the insurance policy best suited to your needs. When you deal directly with an insurer, or through their agent, you are generally only presented with one product and it may not be the best one for you. Brokers are experts in insurance and can arrange the appropriate cover for you from any of the Insurance Companies in India.</p>
            <h4>What does a broker do?</h4>

            <li>Look at your current insurance and make recommendations on any changes or additions if necessary.</li>

            <li>Contact insurers with appropriate products and get the best deal for you.</li><br>
            <p><b>When selecting a product for you, we take into account:-</b></p>
            <li>The quality and extent of the cover.</li>
            <li>The reputation of the insurer for paying claims properly.</li>
            <li>The service standards of the insurer.</li>
            <li>Whether the premium representsgood value for the cover given.
