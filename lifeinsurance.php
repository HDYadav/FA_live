                            <h5>How does this plan work?</h5>
                            <p>This plan is offered through a Master Policy that is issued to you. As the Master Policyholder or the group administrator, you pay premiums that cover the members of your group. The members of your group are covered for a period of one year.</p>
                            <h5>How will the member’s nominee receive the lump sum amount?</h5>
                            <p>As the Master Policyholder, you can choose the lump sum amount that will be provided to the member’s nominee*. It can either be a flat or graded cover amount. When all members of the group have the same Life Cover, it is called the flat cover. On the other hand, when different individuals are offered different Life Cover on the basis of pre-decided grades, it is known as a graded cover.</p>
                            <p>In case of formal groups, this lump sum amount can also be linked to loan amounts, other financial liabilities or even the employee’s salary. When linked to the salary, the Life Cover amount is equal to a multiple of the annual salary. For example, if a member has an annual salary of `10,00,000 and the multiple considered is 2, then his Life Cover amount will be `20,00,000.</p>
                            <p>*Nominee is the person who will receive the Life Cover amount in the absence of the member.</p>
                            <h5>B. GROUP CREDIT LIFE</h5>
                            <p>Group Credit Life plans are non-linked, single premium group term life insurance plan that allows a protection against non-repayment by borrower on the account of his/her unfortunate demise. As an added option, the plan offers a co-borrower cover as well, increasing the risk cover through a separate insurance scheme. The plan is a group credit insurance plan and covers all the loan amounts that have been availed by the members under this policy. The cumulative sum assured at any time will be the cover provided for all the loans taken during a moratorium period and will begin to decrease post that. The sum assured as specified in the Certificate of Insurance will be payable irrespective of the total loan outstanding.</p>
                            <h5>C. GROUP GRATUITY SCHEME</h5>
                            <p><b>What is Gratuity?</b></p>
                            <p>Gratuity is a compulsory benefit to be provided to employees as per the Gratuity Act, 1972. It is a lump sum amount paid out to employees, once they are no longer a part of the company. An employee is eligible for payment of gratuity only if he or she fulfills the conditions specified under the Gratuity Act.</p>
                            <h5>How does this plan work?</h5>
                            <p>As an employer, you can choose to invest a certain amount of money in order to meet your future gratuity liability. The amount set aside by you is invested in a range of equity and debt funds to provide returns over a long term. The kitty created under this plan is then used to make claim payments for gratuity when employees exit.</p>
